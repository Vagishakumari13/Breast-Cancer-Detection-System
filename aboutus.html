            <h5>Breast Cancer Detection System</span></h5>
              <p>Breast cancer occurs when some breast cells begin to grow abnormally. These cells divide more rapidly than healthy cells and continue to gather, forming a lump or mass. The cells may spread (metastasize) to the lymph nodes or other parts of the body. Breast cancer mostly begins with cells in the milk-producing ducts (invasive ductal carcinoma) or in the glandular tissue called lobules (invasive lobular carcinoma) or in other cells or tissue within the breast.<br>Researchers have identified hormonal, lifestyle and environmental factors that may increase the risk of breast cancer. But it is unclear why some women who have no risk factors develop cancer, yet others with risk factors never do. It is likely that breast cancer is caused by a complex interaction of genetic makeup and environment factors.</p>
