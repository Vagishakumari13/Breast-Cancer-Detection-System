        <h3>Breast cancer detection system</h3><br>


       <br><p>Breast cancer (BC) is one of the most common cancers among
            women worldwide, representing the majority of new cancer cases and
            cancer-related deaths according to global statistics, making it a
            significant public health problem in todayâ€™s society.<br>
           <br> The early diagnosis of BC can improve the prognosis and chance of
            survival significantly, as it can promote timely clinical treatment to
            patients. Further accurate classification of benign tumors can prevent
            patients undergoing unnecessary treatments. Thus, the correct
            diagnosis of BC and classification of patients into malignant or
            benign groups is the subject of much research. Because of its unique
            advantages in critical features detection from complex BC datasets,
            machine learning (ML) is widely recognized as the methodology of
            choice in BC pattern classification and forecast modelling.</p><br>
